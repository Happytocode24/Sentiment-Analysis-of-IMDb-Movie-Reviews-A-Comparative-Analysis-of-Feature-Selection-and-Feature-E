# Sentiment-Analysis-of-IMDb-Movie-Reviews-A-Comparative-Analysis-of-Feature-Selection-and-Feature-E
This project is about sentiment analysis of IMDb movie reviews, where each review is classified to a sentiment class of 0 (negative sentiment) or 1 (positive sentiment). In this project, we have explored various feature extraction techniques and feature selection techniques and various Machine learning classification models (SVM, Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Multinomial Naive-Bayes, Decision Trees, XGBoost) to achieve the classification results.

In ADM approach1.ipynb Mutual information gain is used for feature selection and Tf-idf vectorization used for feature extraction.

The file chi2 k=1000.ipynb is a continuation of the previous approach, where Chi-square is used for feature selection and Tf-idf vectorization used for feature extraction.

ADM approach-2.ipynb studies the different feature extraction techniques namely, Count vectorization, Tf-idf vectorization and Word2Vec over various classifier models.
